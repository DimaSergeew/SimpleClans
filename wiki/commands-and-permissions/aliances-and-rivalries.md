# ðŸª– Clan Alliances and Rivalries

An alliance is a great opportunity to solidify your friendly intentions. It allows you to communicate in [ally chat](https://wiki.roinujnosde.me/simpleclans/how-to-setup/configuration#ally-chat) and also prevents friendly fire (can be configured).\
\
Rivalry, on the other hand, draws a line between you. Defeating a rival can increase your KDR (see [settings](https://wiki.roinujnosde.me/simpleclans/how-to-setup/configuration#kill-weights)). As a last resort, you can always declare [war](https://wiki.roinujnosde.me/simpleclans/how-to-setup/configuration#war-and-protection) to finally clarify your relationship!\
\
:warning: Forming an alliance or ending a rivalry **requires confirmation** from the requested clan.
