## Tags

* `default-color` - color used when the clan leader didn't set any colors
* `max-length` - maximum length for tags
* `bracket` - brackets are the characters around the tag, ex.: `[ ]`
  * `color` - the bracket color
  * `leader-color` - this color is used when the player is a leader
  * `left` - the left character
  * `right` - the right character
* `min-length` - minimum length for tags
* `separator` - the separator is a character that separates the tag and the player name
  * `color` - the separator color
  * `leader-color` - this color is used when the player is a leader
  * `char` - the separator character

### Example

```yaml
tag:
    default-color: '8'
    max-length: 5
    bracket:
        color: '8'
        leader-color: '4'
        left: ''
        right: ''
    min-length: 2
    separator:
        color: '8'
        leader-color: '4'
        char: ' .'
```

## General Commands

In this section you can edit the base commands of the plugin. Enable `force-priority` if other plugins are interfering with the commands.

### Example

```yaml
commands:
    more: more
    ally: ally
    clan: clan
    accept: accept
    deny: deny
    global: global
    clan_chat: "."
    force-priority: true
```

## KDR Grinding Prevention

* `enable-max-kills` - by enabling this, you can set a limit on kills per victim.
* `max-kills-per-victim` - this is the limit of kills per victim. If it's set to 10, for example, killing the same player for the 11th time won't affect the KDR
* `enable-kill-delay` - enables a delay between kills
* `delay-between-kills` - this is the delay in minutes between kills

### Example

```yaml
kdr-grinding-prevention:
    enable-max-kills: false
    max-kills-per-victim: 10
    enable-kill-delay: false
    delay-between-kills: 5
```

## Economy

* `creation-price` - the price to create a clan
* `purchase-clan-create` - players must pay to create a clan
* `verification-price` - the price to verify a clan
* `purchase-clan-verify` - players must pay to verify their clans
* `invite-price` - the price to invite a player to your clan&#x20;
* `purchase-clan-invite` - players must pay to invite
* `home-teleport-price` - the price to teleport to the clan's home

## Kill Weights

Here you can set the weight of every kill type. The weight can be negative too. It's used to calculate the KDR like so: (Kill Count \* Kill Wight) / Death Count = KDR

### Example

```yaml
kill-weights:
    rival: 2.0
    civilian: 0.0
    neutral: 1.0
    ally: -1.0
    deny-same-ip-kills: false
```

* `min-size-to-set-rival` - the minimum amount of members a clan needs to add rivals
* `max-length` - the max length of the clan's name
* `max-description-length` - the maximum length of the clan's description
* `min-description-length` - the minimum length of the clan's description
* `max-members` - the maximum amount of members a clan can have

* `trust-members-by-default` - if members are set as trusted by default
* `confirmation-for-demote` - if other leaders (except the one being demoted, of course) must confirm the demotion
* `percentage-online-to-demote` - the percentage of online leaders to demote
* `ff-on-by-default` - if the clan's friendly-fire is enabled by default
* `min-length` - the minimum length of the clan's name
* `min-size-to-set-ally` - the minimum amount of members a clan needs to add allies
* `min-to-verify` - The clan must have this amount of members to get verified (moderators can bypass this)

    homebase-can-be-set-only-once: true
    min-size-to-set-rival: 3
    max-length: 25

## Tasks

This section allows you to set the time of collection for the two types of fee. The fees are described on the economy section.

The collect-upkeep-warning is sent when the clan doesn't have enough money to pay for its upkeep.

The time is in the 24-hour clock.

### Example

```yaml
tasks:
    collect-upkeep:
        hour: 1
        minute: 30
    collect-upkeep-warning:
        hour: 12
        minute: 0
    collect-fee:
        hour: 1
        minute: 0
```

## Discord Chat

You can checkout the configuration [here](../integration/discordsrv-integration.md#configuration).

## Clan Chat

* `enable` - enables the clan chat
* `tag-based-clan-chat` - if true, the command to talk on the clan chat is the clan tag
* `announcement-color` - color used for announcements
* `format` - the chat format
* `spy-format` - the spy chat format
* `rank` - the member's rank format (used on the format)
* `leader-color` - the color for leaders (%nick-color%)
* `trusted-color` - the color for trusted players (%nick-color%)
* `member-color` - the color for non-leaders and non-trusted players (%nick-color%)

### Example

```yaml
clanchat:
    enable: true
    tag-based-clan-chat: false
    announcement-color: e
    format: '&b[%clan%&b] &4<%nick-color%%player%&4> %rank%: &b%message%'
    spy-format: "&8[Spy] [&bC&8] <%clean-tag%&8> <%nick-color%*&8%player%>&8 %rank%&8: %message%"
    rank: "&f[%rank%&f]"
    leader-color: '4'
    trusted-color: 'f'
    member-color: '7'
```

## Request

Requests are messages sent to players to decide (accept or deny) on something (joining a clan, promoting someone, etc).

* `message-color` - the message color
* `ask-frequency-secs` - the interval in seconds between each message
* `max-asks-per-request` - maximum amount of messages before the request expires

### Example

```yaml
request:
    message-color: b
    ask-frequency-secs: 60
    max-asks-per-request: 1440
```

## Bulletin Board

* `color` - the color
* `accent-color` - the accent color&#x20;
* `show-on-login` - if enabled, the BB is sent to clan members when they login&#x20;
* `size` - the BB size (when using its command)
* `login-size` - the BB size on login&#x20;

### Example

```yaml
bb:
    color: e
    accent-color: '8'
    show-on-login: true
    size: 6
    login-size: 6
```

## Ally Chat

The Ally Chat config works just like the [Clan Chat](configuration.md#clan-chat) one.

### Example

```yaml
allychat:
    enable: true
    format: "&b[Ally Chat] &4<%clan%&4> <%nick-color%%player%&4> %rank%: &b%message%"
    spy-format: '&8[Spy] [&cA&8] <%clean-tag%&8> <%nick-color%*&8%player%>&8 %rank%&8: %message%'
    rank: "&f[%rank%&f]"
    leader-color: '4'
    trusted-color: 'f'
    member-color: '7'
```

## Spy Chat

Just a few words how it works.\
\
Imagine, we are in different clans. \
You're in `Fenix` and I'm in `Dragon`, but you're an OP \
(or player with `simpleclans.admin.all-seeing-eye` permission). \
\
When **I** write a message in Dragon's clan chat: `/. Good morning, dragons!` \
\
**You** as an _admin_ (OP) will receive that message as well and it would be formatted by `spy-format`. \
So, you will get something like: `[Spy] [C] RoinujNosde: Good morning, dragons!`

## Purge Data

This feature allows you to purge data of inactive players or clans.

### Example

```yaml
purge:
    inactive-player-data-days: 30
    inactive-clan-days: 7
    unverified-clan-days: 2
```

## MySQL Settings

The plugin supports SQLite and MySQL. By disabling MySQL, SQLite will be used automatically.

Set your credentials below to use MySQL on SimpleClans.

### Example

```yaml
mysql:
    username: ''
    host: localhost
    port: 3306
    enable: false
    password: ''
    database: ''
```

## Permissions

In this section, you can give clans specific permissions. In the example below, members of the clan "YourClanNameHere" will receive the permission "test.permission".

* `auto-group-groupname` - if enabled, members of clans will receive the permission "group.TAG" (tag, of course, gets replaced). **Be careful with this setting, if you are using LuckPerms, players could create a clan called "admin" and be automatically added to the corresponding group. If you are using it, disable the creation of such clans (mod, admin, etc).**

### Example

```yaml
permissions:
  auto-group-groupname: false
  YourClanNameHere:
  - test.permission
```

## Performance

* `save-periodically` - The plugin will save its data periodically as opposed to right away, **RECOMMENDED** to set it true.&#x20;
* `save-interval` - The interval **in minutes** in which changes are written to the database.&#x20;
* `use-threads` - The plugin will not use the main thread to connect with the database if this is true, **RECOMMENDED** to set it true.&#x20;
* `use-bungeecord` - Enable it in both spigot plugins, also make sure you have one MySQL connection.

### Example

```yaml
performance:
  save-periodically: true
  save-interval: 10
  use-threads: true
  use-bungeecord: false
```

## Safe Civilians

* `safe-civilians` - Civilians are safe from PvP, even civilian vs civilian combat is disabled

### Example

```yaml
safe-civilians: false
```
